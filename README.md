# Intro. to Machine Learning Final Project (ECGR 4105/5105)
For this following project, the project will use the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset to do image
classification over multiple different classifier’s algorithms. The classifier’s algorithms
aim to process at least three algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support
Vector Machine (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The analysis of this
project is to identify which of the algorithms give the most accurate predictions among
four classes of the brain tumor with the dataset of MRI images. Disclaimer for this
following project, the project is aimed to compare the accuracy alongside multiple
classifiers and would require more testing to be applicable for real-world applications.

Simple color classification and dataset was added to be used as an control group and comparison
between other classifiers.
